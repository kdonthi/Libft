# Libft

This is a library of functions implemented from using just ```write()```, ```free()```, and ```malloc()``` from the C library. </br>

I have attached a PDF called ```Library documentation.pdf``` containing the functions' descriptions, parameters and returns. </br>

Notable functions include: </br>
-```ft_strsplit.c``` - using a linked list to store parts of a string split on a given delimiter </br>
-```ft_memmove.c``` - moving data while taking care of possible overlapping memory </br>
-```ft_itoa.c``` - converting an integer to a string using recursion </br>
